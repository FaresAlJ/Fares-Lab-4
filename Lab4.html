     We understand the world through our experiences and how we see them. Words are limited by definitions, while images transcend them. Here are some images that have shaped my life with both inspiration, love, hope, excitement, and fear.
     
      <p style="color:#9636f6;">
Join me on a journey through  virtual realms, where fantasy and reality merge. From pencil to pixels, each creation is a testament to the ever evolving digital world. Embark on a digital odyssey with Fares as he continues to redefine the possibilities of digital art. Through the fusion of technology and creativity, I invite you to explore, experience, and be inspired by the limitless potential of pixels and passion.

We are continuously creating not just our physical, everyday reality, but the digital world as well. Our contribution to the digital world, is public and permanent. The digital finger print we leave on the world is our responsibility. Create with Intent!
